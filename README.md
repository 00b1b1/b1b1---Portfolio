## About The Project

For a while I was thinking about how popular link pages have become, both for companies and individuals. I've never liked the "free" solutions that many companies provide where they self-promote on every page you create.

That's exactly why I created AstroLinkHub! With this template you will be able to:
- Create your very own links page for FREE.
- Use the colors you want and give yourself all the credits for it.
- And most importantly, update it very easily using JSON.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** -> `v18.17.1` or `v20.3.0` or higher. (`v19` is not supported)
- **Visual Studio Code** -> with the [Official Astro Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode).

Personally I prefer using `pnpm` instead `npm` and to install it you can use:

  ```sh
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone this repo to your computer:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:MarcosKlender/AstroLinkHub.git
   ```
2. Install Astro dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd AstroLinkHub
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Run the Astro dev server:
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```
